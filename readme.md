### Project Description
Pass-Roast is a fun web tool that humorously roasts passwords with playful insults. Just enter a password and click "Roast Me" to get a bold, animated burn along with sound effects.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are using passwords like 123456, password, and their pet's name ‚Äî and no one's publicly shaming them for it. Clearly, the internet lacks tough love for bad passwords.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a web app that serves verbal justice. It roasts weak passwords with savage insults, dramatic text effects, and sarcastic sound effects ‚Äî making cyber-shame great again.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
. Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
. Frameworks used: None (because raw burns need raw code)
. Libraries used: None ‚Äî it‚Äôs pure vanilla JS roast
. Tools used: Any web browser, Notepad++, VS Code

For Hardware:
None ‚Äî just a strong internet connection and the emotional capacity to be roasted

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
No installation needed! Just open the HTML file in any modern browser.

# Run
1.Open index.html
2.Type your password

### Project Documentation

The typing effect simulates a slow, painful roast.
Responsive layout works on mobile and desktop.
